<b>

[cypher-AI](https://getcypherai.com/) brings high quality AI agentic coding right to your computer. We support most major AI providers - OpenAI, Anthropic and Ollama which is 100% free and private.

cypher is also supports [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) tools, allowing you to extend and integrate with a number of servers already available such as Figma or even [your own browser](https://github.com/AgentDeskAI/browser-tools-mcp)!

Have a specific question? Simply highlight text in the editor and cypher will focus there. Want cypher to work on it's own? Give it requirements and even attach an image and let it implement complete features for you - even executing commands.
