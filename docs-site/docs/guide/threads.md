# Threads

[Wingman](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WingMan.wing-man) has a robust **thread** system that allows you to organize sessions. You can create new threads, delete and even branch off an existing thread.

Threads are a useful way to separate out ideas and sessions, maybe you are developing a feature and want to experiment with an idea, this is where **branching** comes in.

:::note
Only one thread can actively stream at a time, for now.

## Branching

Branching will duplicate an existing thread and allow you to work within that new thread without affecting the original thread. If you decide to delete the original thread the duplicate will remain - you can also rename it.

You can view the relationships between threads by clicking the **graph icon** next to the thread dropdown.
